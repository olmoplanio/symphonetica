# Symphonetica â€” A System for Natural Phonetic Transcription

**Symphonetica** is a typographic philosophy, method, and font system for **natural phonetic transcription**.  
It provides tools for expressing realistic and linguistically sound phonological reconstructions in historical, comparative, and synchronic studies.

Symphonetica is designed to support a broad spectrum of phonetic and phonological representations across time periods, scripts, and scholarly traditions.

## Fonts in the Symphonetica System

The system includes four fonts, designed for precision and typographic elegance:

- **Laudosia Regular**  
  A high-legibility font for English text and naturalistic phonetic transcription. Suitable for body text in academic work involving reconstructed pronunciations.

- **Laudosia Literal**  
  A stylistically distinct companion to Laudosia Regular, intended for quoting **Latin, Greek, Coptic, and other alphabetic** script sources. Maintains philological neutrality while remaining typographically harmonious.

- **Hibis Hiero**  
  A specialized font based on **Noto Sans Hieroglyphic**, extended with phonologically motivated **ad hoc signs** for Ancient Egyptian. Tailored for phonological and diachronic analysis using hieroglyphs.

- **Hibis Demotic**  
  A custom-designed font for the **Demotic script**, built for typographic use in linguistic and historical publications. Includes additional signs needed for accurate transcription and analysis.

## Format and Usage

Fonts are provided in **TrueType (TTF)** and **OpenType (OTF)** formats, ready for use in digital publications, typesetting environments, and academic documentation.

## License

All fonts in the Symphonetica project are distributed under the  
[SIL Open Font License (OFL)](https://scripts.sil.org/OFL),  
allowing free use, modification, and redistribution for both academic and commercial purposes, with attribution.
